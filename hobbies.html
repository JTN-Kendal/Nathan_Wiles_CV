    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Software Development</strong> - I've dabbled with software development on and off for many years but never stuck with it. In 2021 I took a techincal analysis course with Imperial University which used Python as the core tool. As a result of that I started the 100days of Python course with Dr Angela and have really enyjoyed using python for both analysis and building other random projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Science</strong><a href="https://github.com/JTN-Kendal">(Github profile)</a> - The Imperial analytics course introduced me to data science generally and as a result I've become quite interested in data science, doing additional coures and brushing up on A-level Maths. I enjoy the process of exploring data and then applying models, in a simplistic way, to uncover insights that can't be achieved with more traditional BI approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Running</strong> - I'm an avid if not very quick runner. I love to run off-road on trails and paths, and have set myself a goal of completing a 10k OCR in 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>Baking Bread</strong> - Like many people I discovered bread making in lockdown 1.0 and have continued baking ever since. Its great fun to do with the kids and tastes even better. </li>
      <li><strong>Writing</strong> - I enjoy writing short shorties. When I was a around 9 or 10 my gran gave me a 'digital' typewriter. The digital elememt was a small display that copied the keystroke electronically as-well-as punching out the keys on paper. I loved the feel of the keys, and solid clunk it would make as the key struck the paper. Thinking about it before that I had my dads old old typewriter, which had a ribbon, black keys and was forever ceasing up as the keys caught on each other if you hit two too close together. From then I've always enjoyed capturing short stories, and using a narrative style for written communication across mediums and media.</li>
      <li>Not sure its really a hobbie but I love listening to music, especially if its load so you can feel it. </li>
