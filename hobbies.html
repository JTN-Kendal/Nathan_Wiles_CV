    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Software Development</strong> - I've dabbled with software development on and off for many years but never stuck with it. In 2021 I took a techincal analysis course with Imperial University which used Python as the core tool. As a result of that I started the 100days of Python course with Dr Angela and have really enyjoyed using python for both analysis and building other random projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Science</strong><a href="https://github.com/JTN-Kendal">(Github profile)</a> - The Imperial analytics course introduced me to data science generally and as a result I've become quite interested in data science, doing additional coures and brushing up on A-level Maths. I enjoy the process of exploring data and then applying models, in a simplistic way, to uncover insights that can't be achieved with more traditional BI approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Running</strong> - I'm an avid if not very quick runner. I love to run off-road on trails and paths, and have set myself a goal of completing a 10k OCR in 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>Baking Bread</strong> - Like many people I discovered bread making in lockdown 1.0 and have continued baking ever since. Its great fun to do with the kids and tastes even better. </li>
